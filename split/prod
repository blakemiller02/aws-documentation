Service account was created in original account that was to be split into Production environment. This service account was given ReadOnlyAccess to all AWS resources in the account. It was then linked to Former2, a free CloudFormation/Terraform template creator. 
All required resources were selected in Former2 and combined to make a .YAML template. This template was saved and then uploaded to AWS CloudFormation on the destination prod account. CloudFormation job was executed and created all resources.
